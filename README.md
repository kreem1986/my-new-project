##Handwritten Signature Recognition System using Artificial Intelligence.
##Project Idea: Handwritten Signature Recognition System using Artificial Intelligence.
##Background: The problem this project aims to solve is recognizing handwriting patterns and identifying individuals through their handwritten signatures. This issue is commonly encountered in security systems, identity verification, and legal signature recognition. The project holds significant importance in improving the accuracy of signature recognition, facilitating verification and authentication processes securely.
##Data and Artificial Intelligence Techniques: The project will rely on a large dataset of images containing handwritten signatures from diverse sources. Image processing and feature extraction techniques will be employed to handle the signatures. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to train the signature recognition model, and performance can be enhanced using Transfer Learning techniques when data is limited.
#How it will be Used: The solution can be applied in various domains, such as:
Identity verification in legal transactions and financial operations.
Securing systems and restricted areas with biometric authentication.
Assisting visually impaired individuals in tasks reliant on handwritten signatures.
##Challenges: The project may face challenges, including:
Variability in handwriting patterns and differences among individuals.
Recognizing signatures under different conditions, such as fast writing or low-quality images.
##Future Prospects: The project can grow by improving recognition accuracy using larger and more diverse datasets, and by employing more advanced techniques like Graph Neural Networks to enhance signature recognition and representation.
